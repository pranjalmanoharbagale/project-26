Once you have your chicken marinated, rice and fried onions ready, start by cooking the marinated chicken.
Once the chicken is partially cooked, it’s important to layer it with the fried onions, mint and coriander.
The onions add sweetness and richness while the herbs add a ton of flavor.
This is then layered with rice and then topped finally with soaked saffron and ghee.

Step by step pictures to show you how to make Chicken Biryani
And there you go! The whole thing takes approximately an hour so I call this a weekend project,
but after you’ve done it once, you’ll realize how easy and simple making biryani at home is!
The results of your labour will look like this, and trust me, there is nothing like the smell of
chicken biryani wafting through the house to get everyone to the table!

Chicken Biryani served in a dutch oven straight from the stove
Let’s just say – five attempts to make sure I provide you with instructions that you can actually follow with
ease at home did not seem like work.

Also pro tip: it’s really important to use a heavy-bottomed pot when you make chicken biryani, or the chicken
pieces can be scorched or burnt. A dutch oven will be your best friend while making this biryani because it
heats evenly and stays warm. It also has a thick bottom that does not let your food get burnt easily.
